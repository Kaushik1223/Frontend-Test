Here’s a more formal version of the problem statement:

1. **Design and develop a comprehensive trade reconciliation service** that validates the data in confirmation invoices against the uploaded Broadridge report.
2. **Automate document reading and trade confirmation processes** by creating robust functional utilities.
3. **Integrate the application** and assess its performance across varying input sizes, with a focus on optimizing memory usage.

Here’s a proposed solution:

1. **Develop a robust OCR and text extraction system** to accurately read and extract data from confirmation invoices and Broadridge reports. This system will use advanced algorithms to ensure data integrity and precision.
   
2. **Implement a trade reconciliation engine** that compares the extracted data from invoices and Broadridge reports, identifying and highlighting discrepancies. This engine will be optimized for accuracy and speed.

3. **Automate the entire reconciliation workflow**, including document processing, data extraction, comparison, and report generation. The automation will reduce manual effort and minimize errors.

4. **Optimize the application for performance and memory efficiency** by using efficient data structures, parallel processing, and load balancing techniques to handle varying input sizes without overloading system resources.
