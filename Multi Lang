Hereâ€™s a more formal version of the problem statement:

1. **Design and develop a comprehensive trade reconciliation service** that validates the data in confirmation invoices against the uploaded Broadridge report.
2. **Automate document reading and trade confirmation processes** by creating robust functional utilities.
3. **Integrate the application** and assess its performance across varying input sizes, with a focus on optimizing memory usage.
